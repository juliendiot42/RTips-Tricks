# R-Studio configuration

My favorite `r R` IDE is [R-Studio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). It is free and open-source and provides a lot of powerful features.

This section presents interesting R-Studio settings and my current setup.

To setup R-Studio go to: `Tools -> Global Options...`.

A documentation for these settings is available [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200549016-Customizing-RStudio). It might not be up to date but most of the settings are presented.



<div class="note">
Some useful R-Studio settings are not activated by default, I think it's worth taking some time to check these settings.
</div>


## Pane layout and appearance

`Tools -> Global Options... -> Pane layout`

In order to have **more space for the editor**, we can **move the console on the top right corner** and move the "Environment pane" to the bottom right.

Indeed, the panes on the bottom left do not need to be displayed constantly.

![The editor takes the the whole windows](src/img/RS-layout.png)


As you can see, I prefer **dark theme** because it's more pleasant for my eyes. My favorite one is "Idle Fingers". However, several other themes are available, some a light other are black.

I also use the font [**"Fira code"**](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode), this font provide programming ligatures:

<div class = "row">
<div class = "col-md-6">

![Courier 10 pitch](src/img/fontCourrier.png)
</div>
  
<div class = "col-md-6">

![Fira Code](src/img/fontFira.png)
</div>
</div>





## General settings {#generalSettings}

![General settings](src/img/RS-general.png)

It is important to **not** restore or save your workspace at startup or end of the R session. By this way, you will always start R-Studio in a fresh and clean environment, and  because you have saved your script you can regenerate the environment by running it. This is much better for the reproducibility of your work.





## Code settings {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

`Tools -> Global Options... -> Code`

I present here my personal settings. The highlighted lines are those I find interesting.

### Editing


![Editing Settings](src/img/RS-edit.png)


- **Insert matching parens/quotes**: When typing a paren, quote, or brace automatically insert a matching one and position the cursor between them.
- **Auto-indent code after paste**: Automatically execute a Reindent on blocks of R code pasted into the editor.
- **Vertically align arguments in auto-indent**: Preserve the current indentation level for function arguments split across multiple lines.
- **Enable code snippets**: see the corresponding [section](#snippets).


### Display

<center>
![](src/img/RS-display.png)
</center>

- **Highlight selected word**: Add a background highlight effect to all instances of the currently selected word within the document. (Useful to find some variables in the code)
- **Show line numbers**: Show or hide line numbers within the left margin. (Useful for debugging)
- **Show margin**: Display a margin guide on the right-hand side of the source editor at the specified column. (The "good practices" require to have line smaller than 80 characters)
- **Show whitespace characters**: Display glyphs indicating where whitespace characters (tab, newline, etc.) are located in source documents. (Useful to detect "double spaces" and tabulation)
- **Highlight R function calls**: Highlight R functions. (Better distinction between functions and other R objects)

### Saving

<center>
![](src/img/RS-save.png)
</center>

- **Ensure that source files end with a new line**: It's a good practice to end coding file with a new line.
- **Strip trailing horizontal whitespaces when saving**: Remove whitespaces from blank line:

![Effect of `Ctrl` + `S`](src/img/RS-remWhiteSpace.gif)

- **Auto-save**: New feature of **R-Studio 1.3**

### Completion

<center>
![](src/img/RS-completion.png)
</center>

Completion help to write functions name and their parameters just by taping the first letters and the `tab` key:

![Press `tab` for automatic completion](src/img/RS-completion.gif)

### Diagnostics

<center>
![](src/img/RS-diagnostic.png)
</center>

- **Show diagnostics for R**: Check to display alert messages in the margin of the editor when R code appears incorrect.

![Different diagnostic results](src/img/RS-diagnostic.gif)



## Spellchecking

![R-Studio 1.3 provide real time spellchecking](src/img/RS-spellCheck.png)



## Export your configuration

From R-Studio 1.3, the configuration is saved at `~/.config/rstudio` (at least for Linux users). It is then easy to save and retrieve your personal configuration. This folder contain:

- The R-Studio settings: `rstudio-pref.json`
- The [snippets](#snippets)
- The personal dictionary

# Working with R-Studio

- Rstudio **features**:
  - click to see variables
  - keyboard shortcut
  - R-project (project options)
    - `renv` package
  - addins
  - Code Outline (navigate in code)


## Panes {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

### Environment

![Environment pane](src/img/RSTools-Env.png)

- The Environment pane presents the variables defined in your environments. By default, it shows the global environment but you can select others (like those of the loaded packages).

- The ![broom](src/img/RSTools-EnvButton.png) button clear the workspace.

- An easy and graphical way to import data of different types (text, excel, SAS ...) is to use the ![import Dataset](src/img/RSTools-EnvButton2.png) button. The corresponding R code will be written in the console, you can then copy/paste it in your scripts.

- You can visualize the variables defined in your environments by clicking on them. This is a shortcut for a call to the R function `View()`.

![Click on your R objects to view them in the main window](src/img/RSTools-Env.gif)






### File browser

![R-Studio file pane](src/img/RSTools-file.png)

By default, it is open at your current working directory. You can navigate through your file and set up a new working directory with the button ![](src/img/RSTools-fileMore.png).

It's quite convenient to manage the files directly from R-Studio. If you are working in a [projects](#Rproj), you can quickly access to your root folder with the ![](src/img/RSTools-fileR.png) button. 



### Packages

![R-Studio package pane](src/img/RSTools-pkg.png)

In the package pane, you can **install new packages**. It's particularly convenient when you don't know the exact package name.

![](src/img/RSTools-pkgInst.png)

With the update button you can also check if some of your packages are not up to date. With the ![](src/img/RSTools-pkgUpButton.png) button, you can access to **the news file** of these packages to see what is new. (See also section [CRANalert](#cranalert) for a notifier tools about updated packages).

![](src/img/RSTools-pkgUp.png)


### Jobs

![Jobs pane with 2 finished jobs](src/img/RSTools-jobs2.png)

Click on the ![start local job](src/img/RSTools-jobsButton.png) button or source a file as a local job to run an R script in an background R session.

![](src/img/RSTools-jobs4.png)

By this way you can continue to work on R-Studio with an available console while a script is running.

![Jobs pane with a running job showing some outputs](src/img/RSTools-jobs.png)

<div class="note">
You can find more information on this [R-Studio blog post](https://blog.rstudio.com/2019/03/14/rstudio-1-2-jobs/).
</div>







<!-- ### Build -->

<!-- ![Build pane](src/img/RSTools-Build.png) -->

<!-- When you develop a R package, you can manage your test / checks / build in the pane.-->

### Git

![Build pane](src/img/RSTools-Git.png)

If you work with Git in your R-Project, you can run the main git commands in this pane: 

- Stage / commit
- Pull / Push
- View diff and history
- Create / checkout branches

### Tutorial

<div class="note">
It7s a new feature included in R-Studio 1.3
</div>

Some R packages provides tutorials thanks to the [`learnr`](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) package. You can try them in this pane. 

![Data basics tutorial running in the pane](src/img/RSTools-tuto.png)

## R-Project {#Rproj}

When you work, ~~I hope~~ you keep all your files associated with a project in one specific directory in your computer. R-Studio provide a built-in support for this via "projects".

You can find some information about R-Project in this [R-Studio support article](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects)
 or at this [*R for Data Science* section](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html#rstudio-projects).

### Advantages 

The main advantages to work with R-Projects are:

- When a R-Project is open, the current working directory is automatically set to the project directory. A R-Project can then be **shared across multiple users** on different computers without thinking about setting the working directory.

- When a R-Project is open, you get back to where you left off: The **previously opened files are restored** into the editor tabs such as the command history (if it had been saved). Even the files that had *never* been saved (named `Untitled1` in the editor) are restored.

- You can use Git from R-Studio.

<div class="note">
Of course the global environment is not restored if R-Studio is setup correctly as explained in this [section](#generalSettings).
</div>

### Create R-Project 

You can create a new R-Project either by clicking on `File -> New Project...` or on the ![project](src/img/RS-project.png) button.

You can then choose to create it in an existing directory, or to create a new one. In this case, R-Studio provides different templates: "R package", "Shiny Web Application", "Plumber API" ... After creation, the directory will already contain some files and folder.

![Differents project templates](src/img/RS-project2.png)

There is no template for data analysis projects, but a simple structure can be:

```{r echo=FALSE}
dir_tree("projectExample/")
```


### How it works 

R project is a directory containing a `.Rproj` file which can be open by R-Studio. When you open a `.Rproj` file, the following happens:

- A new R session (process) is started
- The `.Rprofile` file in the project's main directory (if any) is sourced by R
- The `.RData` file in the project's main directory is loaded (if project options indicate that it should be loaded). 
- The `.Rhistory` file in the project's main directory is loaded into the R-Studio history pane (and used for Console Up/Down arrow command history).
- The current working directory is set to the project directory.
- Previously edited source documents are restored into editor tabs
- Other R-Studio settings (e.g. active tabs, splitter positions, etc.) are restored to where they were the last time the project was closed.

The `.Rproj` file is a text file (you can try to open it with a text editor) containing the project settings. These settings can be modified in `Tools -> Project Options...`. It is important to know that **these settings have priority** over the standard R-Studio settings.


<h2></h2>
<div class="note">

- If your R project is included in a Google Drive folder, you can encounter some troubles when saving your files.

- Even if the `.Rproj.user` folder is not so big, it can contain a lot of small files. It can then take a long time be synchronized on clouds services.

</div>


## Keyboard shortcuts and useful command

R-Studio provide a lot of **very useful** commands accessible from the menu bar (`File`, `Edit`, `Code`, `Session` ... ). 

These commands are linked to keyboard shortcuts. Even if it is not easy to learn, it will significantly improve your productivity.

The default shortcuts can be modify through: `Tools -> Modify keyboard shortcuts...`

The list below is just a non-exhaustive list of my favorite shortcuts / R-Studio functionality.


<div class="note">
- Remember, if you are doing an annoying and repetitive task, there is probably a shortcut for that!
</div>


### Basic

These shortcuts are similar to those of other softwares.

- `Ctrl` + `Z` : Undo

- **`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `Z`** : Redo (this is not the usual convention!)

- `Ctrl` + `O` : **O**pen file

- `Ctrl` + `A` : Select **a**ll

- `Ctrl` + `S` : **S**ave file

- `Ctrl` + `F` : **F**ind in the current file

- **`Ctrl` + `Shit` + `F`**: **F**ind in files (to search across multiple files)

- **`Ctrl` + `w`** : Close tab

- **`Ctrl` + `Tab`** : Go to next tab

- `Ctrl` + `Q` : Quit R-Studio

- `Tab` : Indent / Autocompletion

- `Shift` + `Tab` : Outdent

- **`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `F10`** : Restart R session. **You should do it quite often !**

- `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `H` : ~~Choose working directory~~ Not needed because you are working in a R-Studio project. 😉


### Help

- **`Alt` + `Shift` + `K`** : Show **k**eyboard shortcuts

- `F1` : Show function help

- **`Ctrl` + `Click`** : (on a function) Go to function definition.


### Run code

- `Ctrl` + `Enter` : Run selected lines

- `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `B`/`E` : Run code from **B**egining to line or from line to **E**nd

- `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `Shift` + `P` : Profile selected lines (see: [profiling section](#profiling))


### Editor

- **`Alt` + `-`** : insert `<-`

- `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `M` : insert a pipe `%>%`

- `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `C` : (un)**C**omment code

![`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `C`](src/img/KS-comment.gif)

***


- `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `/` : Reflow comment

![`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `/`](src/img/KS-comment2.gif)
 
***

- `Ctrl` + `I` : Auto **i**ndentation
- `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `A` : Auto reformat code (with format convention)

<div class = "row">
<div class = "col-md-6">

![`Ctrl` + `I`](src/img/KS-autoIndent.gif)

</div>
  
<div class = "col-md-6">

![`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `A`](src/img/KS-autoFormat.gif)

</div>
</div>

***

- **`Ctrl` + `P`**: Jump to Matching Brace/Paren. Very useful to **debug "Brace related errors"**

![`Ctrl` + `P`](src/img/KS-CtrlP.gif)

***

- `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `Up`/`Down` : Add cursor above or below
- `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `Click` : add a new cursor (Useful on Windows when you copy/paste file path and you want to double the `/`)

![`Ctrl` + `Alt` + `Click`](src/img/KS-CtrlAltClick.gif)

***

- **`Ctrl` + `Alt` + `Shift` + `M`**: Rename in scope. It is much more intelligent than a simple "find and replace". On the example below, neither the variable `a` outside the function nor the variable `alex` is affected.

![`Ctrl` + `Alt` + `Shift` + `M`](src/img/KS-rename.gif)

***



### R markdown

- **`Ctrl` + `Shit` + `K`**: **K**nit document
- `Shit` + `Tab` : Autocompletion / snippets
- **`Ctrl` + `Alt` + `I`** : **I**nsert a new chunk
- **`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `Enter`**: Run current chunk
- `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `P` : Run all **p**revious chunks 

## Addins

Some R packages includes some R-Studio addins. 

You can launch an addin using the ![addin](src/img/RS-AddinsButton.png) button.



These addins provides new functionality to R studio like: [Color picker](https://github.com/daattali/colourpicker), [create data.frame from clipboard](https://github.com/MilesMcBain/datapasta)...

![Addins can be installed with "Browse RStudio addins" ](src/img/RS-Addins.png)

# `.Rprofile` file

The `.Rprofile` file can be used to customize the environment at the startup of R. This file should be place in the your HOME directory, or inside a folder of a R-project. In this case, the one inside the project take precedence over the other.


When R starts, it automatically sources the `.Rprofile` file. So it can be used to setup some R options like: `options(max.print = 200)` to reduce the number of printed lines or `options("scipen" = 999)` to disabled the scientific notation.

There is also two interesting functions: `.First( )` which will be run at the start of the R session and `.Last( )` at the end of the session.

You can try to copy this this line in your `.Rprofile` file:

```{r eval=FALSE}
.First <- function(){
  cat("Welcome", Sys.info()["user"], "!\n")
}
```


<div class="NOTE">
You should not modify options that can have an effect on the R behavior ! For example setting `options(stringsAsFactors = TRUE/FALSE)` in your `.Rprofile` file is a bad idea. Indeed, your codes might not run well on another computer.
</div>


# Snippets {#snippets}

Code snippets are text macros that insert a piece of code.

Some are already installed in R-Studio like:


<div class = "row">
<div class = "col-md-6">

![`for` snippet](src/img/Snip-for.gif)

</div>
<div class = "col-md-6">
![`if` snippet](src/img/Snip-if.gif)

</div>
</div>


You can also create **your own snippets**. 

Instead of copy pasting your work from other project it can be interesting to create a snippet. For example I use some snippet to generate the code of [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/r/) interactive graph. You can see below another example of a snippet generating a custom color palette:

![snippet to generate a color palette](src/img/Snip-myColor.gif)


You can find more information in this [Rstudio support article](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/204463668-Code-Snippets?version=1.3.957&mode=desktop)

## Create a custom snippet

To create a new snippet, go to: `Tools -> Global Options...` and then `Code` and click on the ![edit snippet](src/img/Snip-editButton.png) button.

You can write your custom snippet in the opened window.

The syntax is quite simple:

```{r class.source = 'fold-show', eval=FALSE}
snippet for
	for (${1:variable} in ${2:vector}) {
		${0}
	}

```

It start with `snippet` followed by the name of the snippet. The contents of the snippet should be written below with an indentation.

Variables of the snippet can be defined using: `${X:varname}`, with  `X` a number. all variable with the same number `X` will be written together when the snippet is used. 

You can also run R code in your snippet by including it inside: `` `r `  `` . For example this snippet return the current date:

```{r class.source = 'fold-show', eval=FALSE}
snippet date
  `r Sys.Date()`
```

![a snippet writing the current date](src/img/Snip-date.gif)


<div class="note">
- The `$` sign is a special character for snippet definition. So in order to included a dollar sign in a snippet, escape the character with a slash: `\$`.
</div>







# R code optimisation

## Microbenchmark

To compare the time of pieces of code, the package [`microbenchmark`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=microbenchmark) is very useful.

```{r class.source = 'fold-show'}
library(microbenchmark)

n <- 10000
print(microbenchmark(
    test1 = {
      x <- list()
      for (i in 1:n) {
        x[[length(x) + 1]] <- rnorm(1)
      }
    },
    test2 = {
      x <- vector(mode = "list", n)
      for (i in 1:n) {
        x[[i]] <- rnorm(1)
      }
    },
    test3 = {
      x <- lapply(rep(1,n), rnorm)
    },
    test4 = {
      x <- as.list(rnorm(n))
    }
))
```


## Profiling {#profiling}

R-Studio integrate a profiling tool using the [`profvis`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=profvis ) package. This tool execute a script and display the time and memory allocation of each line and R functions.

This tool can be very useful to detect the slowest part of your code to improve them in priority.

![Profiling results of a simple example](src/img/RS-profile.png)







# R-Markdown



## rmd templates
  - rmd templates
  - Appendix `sessionInfo()`


## Publish R-Markdown







# Some useful R functions:

## `saveRDS`

An R object (for example the result of a long calculation) can be saved using the function `save()` and then load back with the function `load()`. The problem with these function is that it saves both the objects and their names in the same file. So we cannot reset the object name.

We don't have this problem with the functions `saveRDS()` and `readRDS()`:

```{r}
x <- rnorm(10)
saveRDS(x, "rnorm10.RDS")

y <- readRDS("rnorm10.RDS")
identical(x, y)
```

## `dput()`

This function write the "source code" of an R object:

```{r}
dput(head(iris))
```

## `browser()`

This function interrupt the execution of an expression lunch the "debug mode".

It is very usefull to debug code in a "`apply`" function, in a Shiny application, Plumber API ...

```{r eval=FALSE}
sapply(rep(1,3), function(x){
  browser()
  rnorm(x)
})
```
